### **Engineering Principles**  

1. **Never use the word "everything."**  
   → Be specific. Don’t say "everything" when you can be more precise.

2. **Handle the mess.**  
   → Don't ignore messy problems—solve them.

3. **Let different things be different.**  
   → Don’t force unrelated things to be the same.

4. **Always use UUIDs.**  
   → Use unique IDs for each item.

5. **Look at things.**  
   → Always check the actual data or system instead of guessing.

6. **Never name something "end."**  
   → Be precise: use "endExclusive" or "endInclusive" to show if the end is included or not.

7. **Make dangerous code obvious.**  
   → If a function is risky, name it `_DANGEROUS_DANGEROUS_DANGEROUS_BECAUSE_XYZ`.  
   → If changing code can break things, add `// DANGEROUS DANGEROUS DANGEROUS IF YOU CHANGE THIS THEN XYZ WILL HAPPEN` on every line.

8. **Use the best tools.**  
   → Ask an experienced engineer what tool they recommend.  
   → If they’re not available, ask AI—it’s not perfect but helpful.  
   → If no good tool exists, build one.

9. **Automate repetitive tasks.**  
    → If you do the same thing more than 3 times, find a way to automate it.
